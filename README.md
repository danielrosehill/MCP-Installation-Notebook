# MCP Installation Notebook

A collection of installation notes and guides for various Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, primarily focused on Linux desktop environments but also including CLI installations for other operating systems.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal reference notebook for documenting successful MCP server installations. While created primarily for my own use, these notes are made public in case they might be helpful to others working with MCP servers.

The installation processes for MCP servers evolve rapidly, so all notes include timestamps to indicate when the installation was documented and tested.

## Target Audiences

- **Primary**: Personal reference and documentation
- **Secondary**: Anyone looking for practical MCP installation guidance

## Platforms Covered

- Linux desktop (primary focus, particularly Ubuntu/KDE)
- Cross-platform CLI tools
- Other operating systems where applicable

## Contributing

If you find any inaccuracies, outdated information, or have improvements to suggest, please feel free to open a pull request. Given the fast-moving nature of MCP development, corrections and updates are always welcome.

## Disclaimer

These installation notes reflect working configurations at the time of documentation. MCP servers and their dependencies may change over time. Always refer to official documentation for the most current installation instructions.

## Repository Structure

Installation notes are organized by MCP server name, with each note including:
- Installation date/timestamp
- Platform/environment details
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Configuration notes
- Troubleshooting tips (where applicable)
