# MCP Installation Notebook

A collection of installation notes and guides for various Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, primarily focused on Linux desktop environments but also including CLI installations for other operating systems.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal reference notebook for documenting successful MCP server installations. While created primarily for my own use, these notes are made public in case they might be helpful to others working with MCP servers.

The installation processes for MCP servers evolve rapidly, so all notes include timestamps to indicate when the installation was documented and tested.
