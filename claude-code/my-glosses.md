# Anthropic's Claude Code MCP Notes - My Glosses

Oct 30 2025 based on a version downloaded at that date (in repo)

## Scope Params

``--user`` = User / CLI level  MCP 
``--project`` = Project / repo level MCP

## "Transport" 

SSE is deprecated so these are what will be expected/seen:

HTTP:

``--transport http ``

STDIO:

-``-transport stdio``

## Default = Project Specific!

This is a **huge point* about getting MCP to work with Claude in OS-es without a desktop GUI that's glossed over in the docs!

The **default** scope for ``claude mcp add`` is project/repo level. 

Which is why (this has happened many times!):

- In repo 1, you add an MCP like this 
- You go into repo 2 and wonder why Claude seems to have forgotten about the MCP you just configured 

The answer is that the MCP was project-scoped and is therefore not available outside of that repo.

This is expected behavior, of course. But I still argue that it's a little confusing. 

Or maybe it just speaks to the fact that the default behavior expects everyone to be working in a collaborative code repo: many users will be; some users will never be; some users will use it on solo and collaborative projects at different times and places. But currently, however you run ``mcp add foo`` (without a defined scope) you will be installing the MCP at directory/project level.

Highlight:

If you want some MCPs to be persistent across projects, you **need** to add the ``--scope user`` param!

## Over MCP-ing - Why It's "Discouraged"

A common problem everyone trying out MCP runs into is (regardless of IDE)

- Oh cool, so many amazing MCPs! I want this! I want this! Wait .. there's an MCP for that now! I want them all! 
- Each MCP then provides a bunch of tools 
- Agent is now flooded with task definitions from many MCPs every time it tries to run 
- Agent becomes non-funtional or runs into context mud after a few turns because it's got a gigantic trailing context of MCP definitions to wade through 

A vital UI param that, again, is not highlighted enough (not just Claude, everywhere): enabling/disabling. 

You can *have* a bunch of MCPs (defined, authenticated) but it's not necessarily a problem if you enable them selectively. 

This is (opinionated) a more realistic UI than endlessly creating project specific MCP cofigs: toggle the ones you need and dont need on. Or have the project level config do that (it might).

 Either way - it's worth remembering. 

## Plugins With MCPs 

You can configure this by adding `mcp.json` at the plugin **root**.

I'm not using plugins yet so will write more about this when I do.

## What's "Project Scope"? Note For Solo Development Projects

Something that I've noticed:

- As an individual user, I can create my own `mcp.json` at the base of a repo and it works!

So ... why use the CLI then?

If you're flying solo or using a repo for non dev work there's nothing inherently wrong with creating MCP.json.

Creating a JSON is what Anthropic call "project scope." As far as I know there's in a matching CLI param for this scope ... it's file-defined.

Why/when this is useful:

- Everyone in the repo gets the JSON (ie, it's not git ignored) 
- Everyone working on the project gets those MCPs 

## Clarifying The Terminology

The terminology for the three scopes currently implemented is just a little confusing:

"Local" and "user" scope sound the same. To recapon the difference: user scope will install to the system level config; local scope is confined to the directory (and is the default). 

Project.json kind of achieves the same thing as local scope but is captured as a JSON with the idea (I presume) that it will escape a git ignore and thus be (by default) visible across the repo by contributors. 

If you're using Claude Code on your own repos, the TL;DR is this: user scope installs in the system wide config and local scope just in the repo. Make sure to pass the user parameter if you want the MCP to be available across projects.

## Claude ... Where Are You?

It can be a bit confusing figuring out where Claude's system-level configuration file,

 Basically ```~/.claude`` is where the sysetm/OS level configuration is.

At that level you'll find

```
.credentials.json
history.jsonl
settings.json
settings.local.json
```

System wide slash commands are:

`~/.claude/commands/*.md`

Subfolders, if used, define namespaces.

## Folder Level .claude Folders

If you run Claude from the home directory, as anywhere else, it will do its "thing". Namely:

- Creating ./claude 
- Creating ./claude/settings.loca.json to hold permissions for that part of the FS 

If you've done this, just remember that these are not the system level configurations.
