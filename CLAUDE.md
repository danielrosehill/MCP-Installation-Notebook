The purpose of this repository is to gather some notes about how to install various MCP servers. I create repos like this primarily for my own reference but they are public lest they be of use to anybody else (I prefer creating notebooks as repos rather than gists because I can consolidate notes about a common topic this way).

I will use this notebook to document successful installations.

I will you use to:

- Convert my rough notes/drafts into more polished notes 
- Proofread my notes for typos 
- Organise an index 

It's important that all the notes have timestamps / date markings given that the installation processes change as quickly as the tools themselves do.
